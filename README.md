# **Python 3D game!**

A game based on classics like Doom and Wolfenstein. It will be a first-person shooter game developed from scratch, reminiscent of the style from 1995.

I am using this game to learn more about the Python language and English. This is not an independent project; however, I will use it for educational purposes. And I use the IDE PyCharm to carry out the project development. It will be divided into approximately 6 parts to complete the game, consisting of textures, 3D models, and ray casting.
